title: Optimizing Campaign Outreach for the WomenTechWomenYes Annual Gala

<div class="message">
We just wrapped up our first project at Metis yesterday: using MTA turnstile data and additional demographics datasets to help a non-profit efficiently canvass MTA stations.

### It's not really about the MTA

As our instructor pointed out, finding the busiest MTA stations is trivial. Even the MTA's own website publishes a list of the (10 busiest stations)[http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ffsubway.htm] annually, so all the python jutsu in the world isn't going to provide any value to our client if we only work with is the MTA data. Making a meaningful recommendation for the client is about pulling in other sources of data and using that to inform our recommendations. And that is where the creativity and strategy comes in.

### Tools and skill

This data project was designed to get our cohort up to speed on the 'level 1' python data science libraries pandas, numpy and matplotlib and take us from data acquisition through cleaning, formatting and basic visualization.
